# work-in-progress

Dear visitor,

welcome! Happy to see you here!

In this repository you will find code I'm currently working on.

Right now I'm writing a module to access the data base of the German Federal Statistical Office based on this document:
https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/misc/GENESIS-Webservices_Einfuehrung.pdf

I will constantly improve the code you see, as I advance in my preparation for the Certified Associate Python Programmer examination.
So please keep in mind: What you see here is work in progress!

Nevertheless, comments are highly appreciated!

Have fun,

Melanie
